# Gorgonzolas-Factory
Human-Centered Product Design Project

Final Design Code:

ColorSensorTest: Everything related to the string maze and feedback system (color sensors + feedback LEDs)

ButtonsTest: Everything related to the button box system (buttons + LED strip)


Prototype + Test:
Arduino MP3 + .mp3 files: Audio prototype. Due to sound volume limit, the audio feedback was not used in the final design.

ButtonsTestMega: Using an Arduino Mega for extra storage for MP3 and audio prototype.

LEDMatrixTest + LEDStripTest + RGBTest: Testing with different feedbacks utilizing lights and LED
